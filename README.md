# ZORGBORT (an Ilios bot)

Zorgbort is going to make common tasks easier to do.

## Running Locally

You'll need a publicly-accessible address to configure Slack OAuth. You can create a tunnel with [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) and run `ngrok http 3000` to connect.

You'll need to configure a Slack app to test with at [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps). This will give you the details you need to authenticate the app.

1. `git clone zorgbort`
2. `pnpm install`
3. add these variables to your environment:

    ```bash
    SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET="SECRET"
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="TOKEN"
    GITHUB_TOKEN="TOKEN"
    VALID_RELEASE_USERS="SLACKID,SLACKID2"
    PORT=3000
    ```

4. Run ZORGBORT with `pnpm start`
